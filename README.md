# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-GMM-and-KNN
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) refers to the automatic recognition of emotions using audios that are imported as dataset. Speech Emotion Recognition have received a lot attention in past history due to its wide range of applications in human computer interactions that affects computing and healthcare sectors. It develops intuitive and empathetic human machine interfaces; it is imperative and comprehend and interpret
speech emotions more accurately. Notwithstanding SERâ€™s technology advancements, there are several challenges in language sectors using multilingual situations where existing systems find it difficult to achieve high levels of accuracy. 
## Speech Emotion Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an important tool for enhancing humancomputer interaction and to revolutionize various fields such as healthcare, education, and customer service. Speech emotion recognition recognizes human emotions using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithms to understand emotion variations that are imported in dataset as audio files. Through the thorough analysis and practical verification, this project provides an important basis for further research work in this field. It collectively contributes to the understanding of spectral features and machine learning techniques in speech emotion recognition system.
